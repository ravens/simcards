## shadysim

Research from Dieter Spaar from https://osmocom.org/projects/cellular-infrastructure/wiki/Shadysimpy, useful to understand how to flash a STK app on a simcard
using the normalized KIC1/KID1 key. The code use a local PCSC reader through but can output SMPP PDU, but not interact with a server.
